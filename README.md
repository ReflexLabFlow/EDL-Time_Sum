# EDL-Time_Sum
Python script for post-production and licensing. Accurately calculates the unique, non-redundant usage time of source clips from an EDL, ignoring overlaps and multi-use for precise billing (Meldung rechnen) and royalty reports. It provides both the unique total and the total additive time for comparison. Essential for media professionals! 🎥⏱️
